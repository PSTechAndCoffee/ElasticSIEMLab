<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, I set up a home lab for Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using the Elastic Web portal and a Kali Linux VM by following the instruction guide from the blog post listed. This hands-on experience allowed me to generate and simulate security events on the Kali VM, set up an agent to forward logs and event data to the Elastic SIEM, and query and analyze the ingested logs for actionable insights. This project helped to improve my understanding of SIEM workflows and log management using the Elastic Stack.
